# doc-templates
This repository provides easy-to-use templates designed for different types of content. 

The aim behind a template is to facilitate the writing process, give writing ideas, and guide a writer through the process, so that the output they create is easy-to-follow, in line with company style guidelines, and set in a context of the intended audience.

Currently, the templates are uploaded in the DOC format.

Next template to be added soon:

The work to convert the templates into MD format has already started. Stay tuned for updates!
